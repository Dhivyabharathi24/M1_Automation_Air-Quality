The Requirement of this Mini project is to monitor the amount of gases
present in air and to display the results simultaneously with the help
of wifi in anytime using mobile phones,Laptops.If it exits the fixed
limit it sends a alert message. Tools: *Proteus 8 Software *Code vision
AVR

High level Rquirement:

HL\_1:Combine the values from the sensors. HL\_2:ADC takes place.
HL\_3:Display. HL\_4:Filtering.

Low Level Requirement:

LL\_1:Every sensor will sent the result to microcontroller and the
process begins. LL\_2:At ADC ,the analog values are converted to digital
values. LL\_3:The values will displayed on lcd and can also be viewed in
pc,mobiles via Wifi. LL\_4:Once the fixed values for sensors exceeds,it
will send a signal to kalman filter to starts filtering.

4W AND 1H: 1)When:When the air gets high polluted as smoke,methane and
other gases. 2)Where:In high polluted cities like Delhi and Chemical
Factories. 3)Why:To make the air fit for breathing. 4)What:Monitoring
and filtering.

1H: Air surrounded by us will have certain amount of gases present in
air such as methane,ammonia.If their amount of gases in low level will
not affect us,once it is present in excess amount it causes
allergy,watery eyes and breathing problems.So make the air fit for
breathing we starts filtering the gases by using Kalman filter.

SWOT Analysis: Strength:It will help us know the amount of gases present
around us. Weakness:It will not respond to Humidity changes.
Threats:Over Smoke can cause the sensor to get damage.
